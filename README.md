A WIP rhythm game

Credits:

* Core engine ideas (Conductor object especially) from fizzd in an excellent blog post that can be found [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2014/09/09/an-ld48-rhythm-game-part-2/)

* Music: ðŸ‘€ (from a variety of artists, which is temporary - if I ever release this game I will switch to non-copyrighted music but for now - I am using music that I don't have the rights to use)

* Some assets used are from gamesplusjames
